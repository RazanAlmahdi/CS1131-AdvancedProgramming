The first device known to carry out calculations was the abacus.
The abacus was invented in Asia but was used in ancient Babylon,
China, and throughout Europe until the late middle ages. The abacus uses a system of sliding beads in a rack for addition and subtraction. In 1642, the French philosopher and mathematician Blaise
Pascal invented the calculating device called the Pascaline. It
had eight movable dials on wheels and could calculate sums up to
eight figures long. Both the abacus and Pascaline could perform
only addition and subtraction operations. Later in the 17th century, Gottfried von Leibniz invented a device that was able to add,
subtract, multiply, and divide.
